Detection and Counting Objects in Polygon Zone  

This project detects and counts objects within a user-defined polygonal zone using deep learning-based object detection and tracking. It is useful for applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, and area-specific analytics.  

Features  
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO/SSD for detecting objects in video streams.  
- **Custom Polygonal ROI**: Users can define a specific polygonal zone for counting.  
- **Object Tracking**: Ensures accurate counting by tracking objects across frames.  
- **Colab Integration**: Runs seamlessly on Google Colab with minimal setup.  

How to Use  
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NsKgMQRQGIZRjhpb2hd9HsBjfHHz81nD).  
2. Upload or provide a video stream.  
3. Define a polygonal zone interactively.  
4. Run the detection and counting pipeline.  
5. View the real-time object count within the zone.  

Dependencies  
- OpenCV  
- Deep Learning Framework (YOLO, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab Environment  

Applications  
- Traffic and pedestrian monitoring  
- Security and restricted area surveillance
