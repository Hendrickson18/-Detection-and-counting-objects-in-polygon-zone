# Detection and Counting Objects in Polygon Zone  

This project uses deep learning-based object detection and tracking to detect and count objects within a user-defined polygonal zone. It is useful for traffic monitoring, surveillance, and area-specific analytics applications.  

## Features  
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO/SSD to detect objects in video streams.  
- **Custom Polygonal ROI**: Users can define a specific polygonal zone for counting.  
- **Object Tracking**: Ensures accurate counting by tracking objects across frames.  
- **Colab Integration**: Runs seamlessly on Google Colab with minimal setup.  

## How to Use  
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NsKgMQRQGIZRjhpb2hd9HsBjfHHz81nD).  
2. Upload or provide a video stream.  
3. Define a polygonal zone interactively.  
4. Run the detection and counting pipeline.  
5. View the real-time object count within the zone.  

## Dependencies  
- OpenCV  
- Deep Learning Framework (YOLO, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab Environment  

## Applications  
- Traffic and pedestrian monitoring  
- Security and restricted area surveillance  
- Smart retail analytics
